# 🛡️ Ethical Hacker Learning Path

> Ethical hacking is not about breaking systems.  
> It is about understanding how systems fail — and how to secure them.

This roadmap outlines a **structured learning path** for becoming an ethical hacker with a strong technical and ethical foundation.

---

## 🎯 Core Mindset (Before Anything Else)

Before learning tools or techniques, an ethical hacker must develop:

- Ethical responsibility
- Curiosity and patience
- Documentation habit
- Problem-solving mindset
- Respect for authorization and scope

> No permission = no testing.

---

## Phase 0: Computer & IT Fundamentals

### Why This Phase Matters
Security problems exist because computers work the way they do.

### Topics to Learn
- How computers work (CPU, memory, storage)
- How operating systems manage processes
- Basic command-line usage
- File systems and permissions

This phase builds **technical literacy**.

---

## Phase 1: Networking Fundamentals

### Goal
Understand how data moves across networks.

### Key Topics
- OSI & TCP/IP models
- IP addressing & subnetting
- TCP vs UDP
- DNS, HTTP, HTTPS
- Firewalls and NAT

### Outcome
You should be able to:
- Read network diagrams
- Understand scan results
- Identify trust boundaries

---

## Phase 2: Linux & System Administration

### Goal
Understand and control the systems you are testing.

### Key Topics
- Linux file system structure
- Users, groups, and permissions
- Processes and services
- Logs and monitoring
- Package management and updates

### Outcome
You should be comfortable managing and hardening systems.

---

## Phase 3: Web Technologies

### Goal
Understand how modern applications work.

### Key Topics
- HTTP methods and headers
- Cookies and sessions
- Frontend vs backend logic
- APIs and authentication flows
- Databases (basic concepts)

Web applications are the **largest attack surface today**.

---

## Phase 4: Web Application Security

### Goal
Identify and understand web vulnerabilities.

### Key Topics
- Authentication and authorization flaws
- Input validation issues
- Session management problems
- Business logic errors
- Security headers and HTTPS

Focus on **why vulnerabilities exist**, not just their names.

---

## Phase 5: Scripting & Automation

### Goal
Automate repetitive tasks and think in workflows.

### Key Topics
- Python basics
- Writing small automation scripts
- Parsing outputs
- Tool chaining
- Error handling and logging

Automation separates beginners from professionals.

---

## Phase 6: Capture The Flag (CTF) Practice

### Goal
Apply knowledge in controlled environments.

### Key Topics
- Problem-solving under uncertainty
- Research and documentation
- Hypothesis testing
- Learning from failure

CTFs are learning environments, not real attacks.

---

## Phase 7: Low-Level & Binary Concepts

### Goal
Understand how software behaves at a low level.

### Key Topics
- Memory layout basics
- Program execution flow
- Reverse engineering mindset
- Binary analysis concepts

This phase improves deep technical understanding.

---

## Phase 8: Active Directory & Enterprise Security

### Goal
Understand real-world corporate environments.

### Key Topics
- Identity and access management
- Authentication protocols
- Privilege boundaries
- Trust relationships
- Logging and monitoring

Most enterprise attacks target identity, not machines.

---

## Phase 9: Defensive & Blue Team Awareness

### Goal
Think like a defender.

### Key Topics
- Logs and alerts
- Detection and response basics
- Incident analysis
- Hardening strategies

Good attackers understand defense.

---

## Phase 10: Ethics, Reporting & Communication

### Goal
Become a professional, not just a technician.

### Key Topics
- Writing clear reports
- Explaining risk to non-technical audiences
- Responsible disclosure
- Legal and ethical boundaries

Security is about **communication and trust**.

---

## 🔁 Continuous Learning Loop

Cybersecurity is not linear.

- Revisit fundamentals
- Update knowledge regularly
- Practice in labs
- Document everything

---

## 📌 Final Thoughts

An ethical hacker is:
- Methodical
- Responsible
- Curious
- Always learning

Tools will change.  
**Foundations and mindset will not.**

> Learn deeply. Practice ethically. Document clearly.
