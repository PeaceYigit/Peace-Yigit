# 🧩 Binary Exploitation & Reverse Engineering

> Reverse engineering is about understanding software behavior without documentation.  
> Binary exploitation teaches the consequences of unsafe memory and program logic.

This document reflects my learning methodology for low-level security.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Low-level vulnerabilities exist because:
- Memory is unsafe by default
- Programs trust user input blindly
- Edge cases break assumptions

Understanding binaries allows me to:
- Analyze software logic
- Identify vulnerabilities safely
- Understand modern exploit mitigations

---

## 🧠 Reverse Engineering Mindset

Key focus areas:
- Program flow: entry points, functions, loops
- Input handling: buffer sizes, parsing
- Data transformation: how data moves and is stored
- Trust boundaries: what the program assumes about external input

---

## 🔍 Binary Analysis Goals

- Understand expected inputs and outputs
- Identify unsafe memory operations
- Analyze compiled code vs. source (if available)
- Map data flow through variables and functions
- Recognize potential protections (ASLR, NX, stack canaries)

---

## 🛡️ Defensive Awareness

Reverse engineering is not only offensive:
- Recognize patterns defenders can detect
- Understand why protections exist
- Simulate attacks in lab environments
- Document findings for learning and reporting

---

## 📚 Advanced Topics I Study

- Buffer overflows, stack vs heap
- Format string vulnerabilities
- ROP chains and mitigation bypass techniques
- Static analysis: IDA, Ghidra
- Dynamic analysis: debugging and instrumentation
- Anti-reversing techniques and countermeasures

---

## 📌 Conclusion

Binary exploitation is not about shortcuts; it is about **deep system understanding**.  
Learning these techniques strengthens both offensive capabilities and defensive awareness.
